#Write a shell script that will read the names of two directories <dir1> and <dir2> from the user, and to the following:
#a) Copy all the files with extension '*.c‚Äù in <dir1> to <dir2>. Rename the files as '1.c', '2.c', '3.c', etc. Add a comment line in the beginning of each file as:i. /** Old file name: test.c, New file name: 3.c, Modified by: username **/
#b) Compile all the newly created C programs in <dir2>, and name the executable files as '1.out', '2.out', etc.
#c) Add a line at the end of every file mentioning the date and time of modification.
